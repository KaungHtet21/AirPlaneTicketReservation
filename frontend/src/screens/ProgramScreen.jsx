            Membership Program: Frequent Flyer A flight membership program is a
            loyalty program offered by KAE airlines to reward frequent flyers.
            Members of these programs are offered special benefits, such as
            access to airport lounges, priority check-in, free baggage
            allowances, and the ability to earn and redeem points or miles for
            free flights or upgrades.
          </li>
          <li>
            One of the benefits that some flight membership programs offer is
            the ability to purchase a certain number of tickets in advance at a
            discounted price. For example, an airline may offer a membership
            program that allows members to purchase 10 tickets at a discounted
            rate, which can be used for future travel. As a member, you'll have
            access to exclusive benefits and rewards to enhance your travel
            experience. One of the key benefits of our program is the ability to
            purchase a specific number of tickets in advance at a discounted
            rate.
          </li>
          <li>
            Members can earn flight credits by booking flights through the
            online flight system. Every flight booked earns one flight credit,
            and once a member reaches the required number of flight credits,
            they are automatically upgraded to the next membership level.
            Membership is free; to keep the membership active, newly registered
            members need to fly at least once within the first six (6) months â€“
            if this no activity is recorded, then membership shall be
            automatically terminated.
